The specialized training workshop of the MNE library in Python programming language was held on Thursday, May 16, 2024. This workshop was conducted face-to-face and in a practical environment at the Technical and Engineering Faculty of Azad University, North Tehran Branch.

Designed to enhance skills in neural data processing and brain signal analysis, the workshop aimed to equip students and enthusiasts with the necessary expertise in this cutting-edge field.

MNE, which stands for Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Electroencephalography (EEG), is an open-source Python package used for exploring, visualizing, and analyzing human neurophysiological data, including EEG. It provides tools for various stages of EEG data analysis, such as preprocessing, source estimation, time-frequency analysis, connectivity analysis, machine learning, and statistics.
